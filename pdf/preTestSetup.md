- For each question, submit comprehensive solutions. This includes your architecture design, complete code and clear output screenshots. Incomplete submissions will not be considered for evaluation. 

- We strongly encourage you to commit and push your code to GitHub regularly, at logical milestones in your development process. 

- Please adhere to production-grade coding standards. This includes employing proper naming conventions, maintaining a well-organised folder structure, and providing appropriate comments within your code to enhance readability. This is only an indicative list and you are encouraged to demonstrate other best practices that you are aware of. 

- For **Backend Track** or the Backend question of **Full Stack Track** , select any Backend Framework without utilising external libraries for algorithms. Capture output screenshots from API clients like Insomnia or Postman, **displaying request body, response and response time** for the problem. The output screenshots have to be taken of API calls to your app and not the test server 

- For Frontend Track or the Frontend question of Full Stack Track, it is mandatory to use **React** or **Next** . While **JavaScript** is permitted, the use of **TypeScript** is preferred. Capture output screenshots of both mobile and desktop views of your web application. For styling, only **Material UI** or **Vanilla CSS** are permitted. 

- Any instance of plagiarism, including using another applicant's API credentials, LLMs will lead to immediate rejection.

Develop Logging Middleware 

The 'Logging Middleware' is a critical component for building robust and observable applications. While error logging is essential, we expect you to implement logging that captures the entire lifecycle of significant events within your application – from 

successful operations to warnings, informational messages, and debugging details. Think of logs as the narrative of your application's execution! These logs are crucial for understanding application behavior, performance, and for effective debugging. 

Note: While you have flexibility in choosing your backend language/framework, the Logging Middleware must be a reusable package. If attempting the Full Stack track, both this middleware and your backend application must be developed 

in **TypeScript/JavaScript** to enable the logging package's consumption by the **Frontend** . 

Write a reusable function that makes an API call to the Test Server each time the function is called that matches the below structure: 

Log(stack,level,package,message) 

Integrate this reusable Log function strategically throughout your codebase. Each Log call should provide specific and descriptive context about what's happening. Instead of generic messages, aim for logs that clearly communicate the state, actions, and any relevant data at that point in the code. 

We encourage you to think critically about what information would be most valuable if you were to troubleshoot your application months from now. That's the information you should be logging! 

_// If an error occurs in your application's handler due to a data type mismatch_ 

Log("backend", "error", "handler", "received string, expected bool") 

_// If an error occurs in your application's db layer_ 

Log("backend", "fatal", "db", "Critical database connection failure.") 

The test server has the below API that you can call in your Logging Middleware 

## **Log API (POST)** 

http://4.224.186.213/evaluation-service/logs 

## **Constraints** 

- API is a protected Route 

- Stack, Level and Package Fields accept only the following values (in **lower case** only) 

## **Stack** 

"backend" 

"frontend" 

## **Level** 

"debug" "info" "warn" "error" "fatal" 

## **Package** 

Packages that can only be used in Backend Application 

"cache" "controller" "cron_job" "db" "domain" "handler" "repository" "route" "service" 

## Packages that can be only be used in Frontend Application 

"api" "component" "hook" "page" "state" "style" 

Packages that can be used in both Backend and Frontend Application 

"auth" "config" "middleware" "utils" 

## **Request Body** 

{ 

"stack":"backend", "level":"error", "package":"handler", 

"message":"received string, expected bool" } 

## **Response (Status Code: 200)** 

{ 

"logID": "a4aad02e-19d0-4153-86d9-58bf55d7c402", 

"message": "log created successfully" }
